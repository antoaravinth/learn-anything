> [Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz/) is an Open Source Website built by community to Learn Anything with Interactive Maps

If you want to know more about what we're trying to solve, our plans for the future, how to improve the website, and more you can check the [wiki](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything/wiki).

## Contributing
You can contribute to the website in many ways. The easiest thing you can do to help is to simply use the website and learn things with it. And if you found a resource you like, just add it so everyone can find it too.

Since this website is fully open source, you can also help and work on new and awesome features to add to the website. Read [`Developing the website`](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything/wiki/Developing) section for more information on how to get started with this. And if you never programmed before and this is your first Open Source project, don't be afraid to join in. There are many people that can help you both get started and make your first contribution.

We have a [Slack group](https://join.slack.com/t/learnanythingxyz/shared_invite/enQtMjg1MTcxMjA4NDg2LWU0YjgxZTZmZGY5MTRlMWI3ZWJjYzNhYTg4MmE1OTRjNTQ2MjUwYWI3ZGZlZjg1MDA0OTc3ZDY3ZmMzZDc4N2I) we use for all our communication. Feel free to join in to help make this awesome thing together. ðŸ¦„

## Curated Lists
With our goal of providing the most efficient paths for Learning Anything, we also manage curation of various GitHub lists. Feel free to [explore and improve them if you wish](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything/wiki/Curated-Lists).

## Developing the website
[Here](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything/wiki/Developing) you can read about how you can set up your own instance of Learn Anything to develop with.

## API
[Here](http://docs.learn-anything.xyz/) you can find all the public API endpoints we currently have. We will be adding more in the future.

Below are some things people have built with the API we provide. If you built something yourself, feel free to add it to this list.
- [Alfred Workflow](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-learn-anything) - Alfred workflow to search through all Learn Anything maps.
- [Albert Plugin](https://github.com/nglgzz/albert-plugins) - Albert plugin to search through all Learn Anything maps.

## Keep this project going ðŸ’œ
This project is **built by the community, for the community** and in our goals to make the most efficient paths and the best user experience possible in exploring the maps and finding the resources you need, we can only rely on donations made by our users to sustain this project.

There are **no advertisements** and **no sponsored content** in this website as that would defeat our vision of making the best and most optimal learning tracks for learning any topic in the world.

We have created a [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/learnanything) where you can support our work. Any donation that you make to this project is incredibly valuable to keep this project going. We also have some awesome rewards that come with your support.
